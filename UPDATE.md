## Points I would improve if given enough time

 1. Add more error handling for the API requests.
 2. Add loading indicators while the data is being fetched from the API.
 3. Improve mobile responsiveness across all screen sizes
 4. Perform a unit test on all components to ensure they are functioning correctly.
 5. Turn the project to a multi-page website using react router
 6. I would add more features to the project, such as the embed gallery, launch videos and pictures
 7. Improve the overall styling and layout of the page to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
